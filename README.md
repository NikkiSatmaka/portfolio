## Introduction
Hi everyone this is my Data Science and Data Analysis selected portofolio for easy access in one repository. This repostory would be updated in accordance to my portofolio needs from time to time. Most of the projects that are listed in my resume/CV should be present here. Colaborative projects would be listed with their own repostory links.

## Showcased Projects

Here are some projects that are showcased here:

#### Telco Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks

Conduct descriptive analysis and Build ANN model that predicts churn of teleco services subscription data. Insights: potential bad service types that caused churn and customer clusters based on churn.

#### Animals Image Computer Vision Classifier Using Convolutional Neural Network

Build a CNN computer vision model from scratch and with a pre-trained model to classify ten types of animals. The model is built using TensorFlow Keras library.

#### US Citizen Data income Classification using SVM and Logistic Regression:

Analyze features in correlation to US citizen income bracket and build models to predict income bracket.

#### Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised PCA, K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering Models

Create a Customer Segmentation analysis supported by PCA reduction and Unsupervised Learning of K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering models. found a pattern of three main customer clusters.

#### DVD Rental Advanced SQL Data Query and Analysis

Create a product, sales, and customer analysis of a DVD rental business. The data is fetched from a structured multitable database using advanced SQL queries such as nested queries.

#### [Collaborative Project] Fintbot, a chatbot focused on fintech. Developed using RASA open source

[Repository](github.com/H8-Assignments-Bay/p2---final-project-group-003)

Part of a team that Developed a fintech chatbot. The model is trained using RASA open source, a popular chatbot platform based on TensorFlow. For demo, Fintbot was deployed on telegram app using ngrok.
